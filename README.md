# fast_matrix
A matrix module written in c++ with a python wrapper 


This is meant to be a project for my benefit so i can A, learn how to use ctypes, and B get practice writing fast efficient code
(although i dont this will be very fast or efficient)

list of features i am going to hopefully add:
-Matrix addition/subtraction
-Matrix multiplication
-Matrix vector product
-Matrix scalar product
-Determinent calcuator (most likely wont happen but we'll see)
-A good python wrapper for everthing
-Ability to increase dimensions of the matrix 
-Calcuate transpose
-and maybe more

additional reported issues may or may not get fixed as im pretty busy and this is for my own learning, but
If you still want to use this, go ahead, im not a good coder, so things may break, but thanks for stopping by anyways!
