# fast_matrix
A matrix module written in c++ with a python wrapper 


This is meant to be a project for my benefit so i can A, learn how to use ctypes, and B get practice writing fast efficient code
(although i dont this will be very fast or efficient)

list of features i am going to hopefully add:
-Matrix addition/subtraction
-Matrix multiplication
-Matrix vector product
-Matrix scalar product
-Determinent calcuator (most likely wont happen but we'll see)
-A good python wrapper for everthing
-Ability to increase dimensions of the matrix 
-Calcuate transpose
-and maybe more

If you want to use this, go ahead, im not a good coder, so things may break, but thanks for stopping by anyways!
